# JS GYM

## We are going to practice some algorithm problems using our knowledge of data structures, comparisons, if/else statements, arrays, and objects!

### remember to use references from our past lectures and online resources to help you!

Open each problems folder and you will see a file for each problem. The prompt for each problem is commented at the top of each file.

In order to check your solution plug in the sample input and console.log your function (remember to invoke the function inside of the console.log to see your answer in the terminal!)

recommended order:
1. countToNum
1. countFromNum
1. fizzBuzz
1. stringReversal
1. numberOfVowels
1. separateNames
1. mostFrequentLetter
1. palindrome
1. calculator 
1. birthday
1. iterateBirthday
1. highestAverage
1. addAverageTestScores

## got through all of these? 
If you're feeling good checkout the problems in the extras folder!
